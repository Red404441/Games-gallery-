# Games-gallery-
I made this site for fun in school using a collection of game links i made.
credits go to ChatGPT since i have zero idea how to code and it helped alot and thanks to the tools in https://webcode.tools/html-generator
music credits go to https://catsystemcorp.bandcamp.com/album/palm-mall

some sites may be broken/blocked. this isnt my fault and is either your network filtering options or it is the people behind the site. if you find any issues please let me know

enjoy the site!

Note: i made this for my school to work as a games hub, if the link to this site gets found it is nearly a guarentee to get all sites here banned. I might changed the link frequently.
